# DBMSProject
This is a C-based project to enhance the "toyDB" database system. It involves implementing core DBMS features from scratch, including a page buffer pool with LRU/MRU replacement strategies for the Paged File (PF) layer , a slotted-page structure, and an efficient bulk-loading method for the B+ tree Access Method (AM) layer.
